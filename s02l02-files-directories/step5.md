# Step 5 ‚Äî Removing files and directories with rm

The `rm` command removes (deletes) files and directories. **Be careful - this is permanent!**

---

### üóëÔ∏è Task ‚Äî Practice safe deletion

Create a test file to delete:

```bash
touch test_delete.txt
```{{exec}}

Remove the file:

```bash
rm test_delete.txt
```{{exec}}

Verify it's gone:

```bash
ls test_delete.txt
```{{exec}}

Create another test file:

```bash
touch another_test.txt
```{{exec}}

Use interactive mode for safety:

```bash
rm -i another_test.txt
```{{exec}}

Type `y` and press Enter to confirm.

Remove an empty directory:

```bash
rmdir "My Projects"
```{{exec}}

Remove directory with contents (use `-r` for recursive):

```bash
rm -r archive
```{{exec}}

**‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY WARNINGS:**
- `rm` is permanent - no trash/recycle bin!
- Always double-check paths before using `rm -r`
- Use `rm -i` when in doubt

Click **Check** after practicing safe deletion.
