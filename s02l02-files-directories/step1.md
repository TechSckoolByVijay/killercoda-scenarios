# Step 1 â€” Creating files with touch

The `touch` command is the fastest way to create empty files in Linux.

**Why use touch?**
- Creates empty files instantly
- Updates timestamps of existing files
- Perfect for placeholder files and testing

**Task:** Let's create some files:

```
touch myfile.txt
```

**Task:** Create multiple files at once:

```
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

**Task:** Verify the files were created:

```
ls -l
```

**Task:** Create a file with a space in the name (use quotes):

```
touch "my document.txt"
```

**Pro tip:** Touch can also update the modification time of existing files without changing their content!
