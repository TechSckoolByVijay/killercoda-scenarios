### üìù Task ‚Äî Create files with touch

Let's create some files:

```bash
touch myfile.txt
```{{exec}}

Create multiple files at once:

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```{{exec}}

Verify the files were created:

```bash
ls -l
```{{exec}}

Create a file with a space in the name (use quotes):

```bash
touch "my document.txt"
```{{exec}}

**Pro tip:** Touch can also update the modification time of existing files without changing their content!
