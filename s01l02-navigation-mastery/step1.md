# Step 1 — Explore Your Surroundings 🔍

Welcome to navigation mastery! Think of yourself as an explorer in a digital world - let's learn to see everything around you clearly! �️

## 🔍 Practice Exercise 1: What's in My Current Location?

Let's start by seeing what files and directories are in your current location. This is like scanning a room when you walk in:

```bash
cd ~/workspace && ls
```{{exec}}

**What we're doing:** Moving to your workspace and listing all visible items  
**What you'll see:** A list of files and folders in your workspace - your immediate neighbors in the file system! 📂

## 🔍 Practice Exercise 2: Show Me All the Details!

Now let's get the full story about each item - sizes, permissions, and even hidden files:

```bash
ls -lah
```{{exec}}

**What we're doing:** Using `ls -lah` to show ALL files (including hidden ones) with complete details  
**What you'll see:** A detailed inventory with file sizes, dates, permissions, and hidden files starting with '.' - like having a magnifying glass! 🔍

## 🔍 Practice Exercise 3: Understanding What You See

Let's interpret what all that information means. Each line tells a story about every file:

```bash
ls -l
```{{exec}}

**What we're doing:** Using `ls -l` to see the detailed format clearly  
**What you'll see:** Columns showing permissions (who can do what), file sizes, dates modified, and filenames - it's like reading a file's ID card! 📋
