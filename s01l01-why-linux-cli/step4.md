# Step 4 â€” CLI Benefits in Action

Let's experience the power of CLI firsthand!

**Scenario**: You need to find your current username, check available disk space, and see running processes.

**GUI approach**: Multiple clicks through different system dialogs
**CLI approach**: Three simple commands!

**Task:** Run these commands one by one:

```
whoami
```

```
df -h
```

```
ps aux | head -10
```

Each command gives you instant, precise information:
- `whoami`: Shows current username
- `df -h`: Shows disk space in human-readable format
- `ps aux | head -10`: Shows top 10 running processes

This is the power of CLI - precise, fast, and composable!

Click **Check** after running all three commands.
