# Step 2 â€” Terminal vs GUI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) might seem intimidating at first, but it's incredibly powerful!

**CLI Advantages:**
- **Speed**: Execute complex tasks with simple commands
- **Precision**: Exact control over what happens
- **Automation**: Scripts can repeat tasks perfectly
- **Resource efficiency**: Uses less system resources

**Task:** Let's see the difference in speed. Try listing files using both methods:

`ls -la`{{exec}}

This single command shows detailed information about all files. Compare this to clicking through multiple GUI dialogs!

Click **Check** after running the command.
