# Step 3 â€” Developer Mindset

Successful developers think in terms of:
- **Automation**: "How can I make this faster next time?"
- **Efficiency**: "What's the most direct path to the solution?"
- **Reproducibility**: "Can someone else (or future me) repeat this?"

**Task:** Let's practice the developer mindset. Instead of manually checking the current time, let's use a command:

```bash
date
```{{exec}}

Now let's see system uptime (how long the system has been running):

```bash
uptime
```{{exec}}

These commands give us instant system information without navigating through GUI menus!

Click **Check** after running both commands.
