# Step 6 â€” Navigation practice

Time to put it all together with a navigation challenge!

**Challenge:** Navigate through the filesystem and explore!

**Task 1:** Start by checking where you are and what's here:

```
pwd
ls -la
```

**Task 2:** Navigate to root and explore:

```
cd /
ls
```

**Task 3:** Go to /var/log and see what's there:

```
cd var/log
ls -lt
```

**Task 4:** Go back to root using the shortest path:

```
cd /
```

**Task 5:** Go to /etc and list configuration files:

```
cd etc
ls | head -10
```

**Task 6:** Return home and verify:

```
cd
pwd
```

**Task 7:** Show off your skills - use one command to list your home directory from anywhere:

```
ls -la ~
```

Perfect! You can now navigate confidently through the Linux filesystem.
