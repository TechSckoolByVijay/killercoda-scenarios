# Step 5 â€” cd shortcuts and tricks

Let's learn some powerful `cd` shortcuts that will make you much more efficient!

**Useful cd shortcuts:**

**Task:** Go to your home directory and then to root:

```
cd ~
cd /
```

**Task:** Use the "go back" shortcut:

```
cd -
```

The `-` takes you back to your previous directory! Very useful.

**Task:** Try going back and forth:

```
cd /var
cd -
cd -
```

**Task:** Navigate using relative paths (from /):

```
cd /
cd var/log
pwd
```

**Task:** Use .. to go up multiple levels:

```
cd ../../
pwd
```

**Task:** Go to a subdirectory of home without typing the full path:

```
cd ~/
ls
```

These shortcuts will save you lots of typing!
