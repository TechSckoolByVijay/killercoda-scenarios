# Step 5 â€” cd shortcuts and tricks

Let's learn some powerful `cd` shortcuts that will make you much more efficient!

**Useful cd shortcuts:**

**Task:** Go to your home directory and then to root:

```bash
cd ~
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd /
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Use the "go back" shortcut:

```bash
cd -
```{{exec}}

The `-` takes you back to your previous directory! Very useful.

**Task:** Try going back and forth:

```bash
cd /var
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd -
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd -
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Navigate using relative paths (from /):

```bash
cd /
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd var/log
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Use .. to go up multiple levels:

```bash
cd ../../
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Go to a subdirectory of home without typing the full path:

```bash
cd ~/
```{{exec}}

```bash
ls
```{{exec}}

These shortcuts will save you lots of typing!
