### ⚡ Task — Master cd shortcuts

Go to your home directory and then to root:

```bash
cd ~
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd /
```{{exec}}

Use the "go back" shortcut:

```bash
cd -
```{{exec}}

The `-` takes you back to your previous directory! Very useful.

Try going back and forth:

```bash
cd /var
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd -
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd -
```{{exec}}

Navigate using relative paths (from /):

```bash
cd /
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd var/log
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

Use .. to go up multiple levels:

```bash
cd ../../
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

Go to a subdirectory of home without typing the full path:

```bash
cd ~/
```{{exec}}

```bash
ls
```{{exec}}

These shortcuts will save you lots of typing!
