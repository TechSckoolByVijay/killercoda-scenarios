# Step 4 â€” ls options and flags

The `ls` command has many useful options to show different information.

---

### ðŸ”§ Task â€” Master ls options

Show detailed information (long format):

```bash
ls -l
```{{exec}}

This shows permissions, owner, size, and modification date.

Show all files (including hidden ones):

```bash
ls -a
```{{exec}}

Hidden files start with a dot (.) in Linux.

Combine options for detailed view of all files:

```bash
ls -la
```{{exec}}

Show file sizes in human-readable format:

```bash
ls -lh
```{{exec}}

Sort by modification time (newest first):

```bash
ls -lt
```{{exec}}

Sort by size (largest first):

```bash
ls -lS
```{{exec}}

**Pro tip:** You can combine multiple options like `ls -laht` for all files, long format, human-readable sizes, sorted by time!
