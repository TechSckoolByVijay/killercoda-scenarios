# Step 4 â€” ls options and flags

The `ls` command has many useful options to show different information.

**Common ls options:**

**Task:** Show detailed information (long format):

```
ls -l
```

This shows permissions, owner, size, and modification date.

**Task:** Show all files (including hidden ones):

```
ls -a
```

Hidden files start with a dot (.) in Linux.

**Task:** Combine options for detailed view of all files:

```
ls -la
```

**Task:** Show file sizes in human-readable format:

```
ls -lh
```

**Task:** Sort by modification time (newest first):

```
ls -lt
```

**Task:** Sort by size (largest first):

```
ls -lS
```

**Pro tip:** You can combine multiple options like `ls -laht` for all files, long format, human-readable sizes, sorted by time!
