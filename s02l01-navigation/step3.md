# Step 3 â€” cd: Basic navigation

The `cd` command stands for "Change Directory". It's how you move around in the filesystem.

**Basic navigation:**

**Task:** Go to your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

The `~` symbol represents your home directory!

**Task:** Go to the root directory:

```bash
cd /
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Go to the /var directory:

```bash
cd /var
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Go up one level (to the parent directory):

```bash
cd ..
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

The `..` represents the parent directory (one level up).

**Task:** Go back to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

Note: `cd` without arguments takes you home!
