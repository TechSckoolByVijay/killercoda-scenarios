# Step 3 â€” cd: Basic navigation

The `cd` command stands for "Change Directory". It's how you move around in the filesystem.

**Basic navigation:**

**Task:** Go to your home directory:

```
cd ~
pwd
```

The `~` symbol represents your home directory!

**Task:** Go to the root directory:

```
cd /
pwd
```

**Task:** Go to the /var directory:

```
cd /var
pwd
```

**Task:** Go up one level (to the parent directory):

```
cd ..
pwd
```

The `..` represents the parent directory (one level up).

**Task:** Go back to your home directory:

```
cd
pwd
```

Note: `cd` without arguments takes you home!
