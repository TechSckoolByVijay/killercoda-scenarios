# Step 2 â€” ls: What's here?

The `ls` command lists the contents of a directory. It's like opening a folder in a file manager.

### ðŸ‘€ Task â€” Explore directory contents

Let's see what's in your current directory:

```bash
ls
```{{exec}}

Now let's see what's in the root directory:

```bash
ls /
```{{exec}}

List what's in the home directory:

```bash
ls /home
```{{exec}}

**Key insight:** You can use `ls` on any directory, not just your current one!

Try listing contents of multiple directories at once:

```bash
ls / /home /var
```{{exec}}

This shows contents of all three directories in one command!
