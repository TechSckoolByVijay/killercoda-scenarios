# Step 2 â€” ls: What's here?

The `ls` command lists the contents of a directory. It's like opening a folder in a file manager.

**Basic usage:**

**Task:** Let's see what's in your current directory:

```
ls
```

**Task:** Now let's see what's in the root directory:

```
ls /
```

**Task:** List what's in the home directory:

```
ls /home
```

**Key insight:** You can use `ls` on any directory, not just your current one!

**Task:** Try listing contents of multiple directories at once:

```
ls / /home /var
```

This shows contents of all three directories in one command!
