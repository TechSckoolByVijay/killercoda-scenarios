# Step 4 â€” Configuration (/etc)

The `/etc` directory contains system-wide configuration files. This is where Linux stores most system settings.

**Important `/etc` files:**
- `/etc/passwd` - user account information
- `/etc/hosts` - hostname to IP mappings
- `/etc/fstab` - filesystem mount information
- `/etc/crontab` - scheduled tasks

**Task:** Let's explore the etc directory:

```
ls /etc
```

**Task:** Let's look at the hosts file (used for local DNS):

```
cat /etc/hosts
```

**Task:** Let's see the system's hostname:

```
cat /etc/hostname
```

**Note:** These configuration files control how your Linux system behaves!
