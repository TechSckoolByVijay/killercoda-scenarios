You've mastered the Linux filesystem layout fundamentals!

**Key concepts learned**:
- `/` is the root of everything in Linux
- `/home` contains user personal directories
- `/var` holds variable data like logs and caches
- `/etc` stores system configuration files

**Next steps**: Now that you understand the filesystem layout, you're ready to learn navigation commands in S02L01 (pwd, ls, cd)!
