# S01L02: Linux Filesystem Layout

Welcome to understanding the Linux filesystem! Unlike Windows with drive letters (C:, D:), Linux uses a unified tree structure starting from root (/).

**What you'll explore**:
- The root directory (/) - top of the filesystem tree
- /home - user personal directories
- /var - variable data (logs, caches)
- /etc - system configuration files

**Duration**: ~6 minutes

Understanding this layout is crucial for navigating Linux effectively!
