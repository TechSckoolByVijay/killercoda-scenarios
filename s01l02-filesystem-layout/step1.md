# Step 1 â€” Root Directory (/)

The root directory `/` is the top of the Linux filesystem tree. Everything branches from here!

**Key concept**: Unlike Windows drive letters (C:, D:), Linux has ONE tree starting from `/`

**Task:** Let's explore the root directory structure:

```
ls /
```

You'll see directories like:
- `bin` - essential system binaries
- `boot` - boot loader files
- `dev` - device files
- `etc` - configuration files
- `home` - user directories
- `var` - variable data

**Task:** Now let's see where we currently are:

```
pwd
```

Click **Check** after running both commands.
