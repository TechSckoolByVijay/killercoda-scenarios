# Step 1 â€” Root Directory (/)

The root directory `/` is the top of the Linux filesystem tree. Everything branches from here!

**Key concept:** Unlike Windows drive letters (C:, D:), Linux has ONE filesystem tree starting from `/`.

### ðŸ§ª Task 1 â€” Explore the root directory

Run the command below to list what's inside the root directory:

```bash
ls /
```{{exec}}

You will see directories like:

- `bin` â€” essential system binaries  
- `boot` â€” boot loader files  
- `dev` â€” device files  
- `etc` â€” configuration files  
- `home` â€” user directories  
- `var` â€” variable data

### ðŸ§ª Task 2 â€” Check your current location

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

Click **Check** after running both commands.
