# Step 5 â€” Navigation Practice

Now let's practice navigating between these important directories!

---

### ðŸ§­ Task â€” Practice filesystem navigation

Navigate to the root directory:

```bash
cd /
```{{exec}}

List contents and navigate to var:

```bash
ls
```{{exec}}

```bash
cd var
```{{exec}}

Check where you are:

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

Go back to your home directory using the shortcut:

```bash
cd ~
```{{exec}}

Verify you're home:

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

**Bonus:** You can also use `cd` without arguments to go home:

```bash
cd
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

Great! You now understand how to navigate the Linux filesystem hierarchy.
