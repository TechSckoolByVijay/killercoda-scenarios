# Step 5 â€” Navigation Practice

Now let's practice navigating between these important directories!

**Task:** Navigate to the root directory:

```
cd /
```{{exec}}

**Task:** List contents and navigate to var:

```
ls
```{{exec}}

```
cd var
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Check where you are:

```
pwd
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Go back to your home directory using the shortcut:

```
cd ~
```{{exec}}

**Task:** Verify you're home:

```
pwd
```{{exec}}

**Bonus:** You can also use `cd` without arguments to go home:

```
cd
```{{exec}}

```
pwd
```{{exec}}

Great! You now understand how to navigate the Linux filesystem hierarchy.
