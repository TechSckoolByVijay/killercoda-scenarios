# Step 4 â€” Practice All Together

Let's combine everything you've learned! ðŸŽª

Now you know the **trinity of terminal basics**. Let's practice them in sequence to build muscle memory.

## Your Mission: The Terminal Basics Flow

Follow this sequence - the workflow every Linux user does daily:

### 1. Check where you are:
```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

### 2. Confirm who you are:
```bash
whoami
```{{exec}}

### 3. Clean your workspace:
```bash
clear
```{{exec}}

### 4. Try the keyboard shortcut for clear:
```bash
# Press Ctrl + L instead of typing clear
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What You've Mastered

âœ… **pwd** - Your GPS in Linux  
âœ… **whoami** - Your digital ID card  
âœ… **clear** - Your screen cleaning tool  

## ðŸš€ Real-World Usage

These commands form your **daily Linux ritual**:
- Start session â†’ `pwd` (where am I?)
- Check privileges â†’ `whoami` (who am I?)  
- Clean workspace â†’ `clear` (fresh start!)

## ðŸ’ª Next Level

You've just had your first real conversation with Linux! These might seem simple, but they're the foundation of everything you'll do.

**Pro Tip:** Try combining commands with `&&`:
```bash
pwd && whoami && clear
```{{exec}}

This runs all three commands in sequence!
