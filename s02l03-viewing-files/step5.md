# Step 5 — Real-time file monitoring

The most powerful feature of `tail` is real-time monitoring with the `-f` flag!

**Real-time monitoring:**

**Task:** Create a log file and monitor it:

```
touch myapp.log
```

**Task:** Start monitoring in real-time:

```
tail -f myapp.log
```

Now the terminal will wait and show new lines as they're added!

**Task:** Open a NEW terminal (or new tab) and add content:

```
echo "Application started" >> myapp.log
echo "User logged in" >> myapp.log
echo "Processing request" >> myapp.log
```

Watch how the content appears in real-time in your monitoring terminal!

**Task:** Stop monitoring by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the monitoring terminal.

**Advanced monitoring:**

**Task:** Monitor multiple files:

```
tail -f myapp.log /var/log/syslog
```

**Task:** Monitor with line count:

```
tail -n 20 -f myapp.log
```

**Real-world scenarios:**
- 📊 **Development**: Monitor application logs while testing
- 🔍 **Debugging**: Watch error logs in real-time
- 📈 **System Admin**: Monitor system logs for issues
- 🚀 **Deployment**: Watch deployment logs during releases

**Pro tip:** Use `tail -f` during application development to see logs as your code runs!
