# File viewing mastery achieved!

You now know how to efficiently view files in any situation!

**Commands mastered**:
- `cat` - for small files and quick views
- `less` - for large files with interactive navigation
- `head` - for quick previews and first lines
- `tail` - for recent entries and log monitoring

**Key techniques learned**:
- Use `less` for large files to avoid terminal flooding
- Use `head` and `tail` with `-n` for custom line counts
- Use `tail -f` for real-time log monitoring
- Navigate efficiently within `less` using space, q, /search

**Next steps**: Ready to learn search and filtering with grep and pipes in S03L01!
