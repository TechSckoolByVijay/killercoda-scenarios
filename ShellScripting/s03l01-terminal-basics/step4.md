# Step 4 — Practice All Together

Let's combine everything you've learned! 🎪

Now you know the **trinity of terminal basics**. Let's practice them in sequence to build muscle memory.

## Your Mission: The Terminal Basics Flow

Follow this sequence - the workflow every Linux user does daily:

### 1. Check where you are:
```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

### 2. Confirm who you are:
```bash
whoami
```{{exec}}

### 3. Clean your workspace:
```bash
clear
```{{exec}}

### 4. Try the complete combo:
```bash
pwd && whoami && clear; echo "step4_done" > /tmp/step4_done
```{{exec}}

## 🎯 What You've Mastered

✅ **pwd** - Your GPS in Linux  
✅ **whoami** - Your digital ID card  
✅ **clear** - Your screen cleaning tool  

## 🚀 Real-World Usage

These commands form your **daily Linux ritual**:
- Start session → `pwd` (where am I?)
- Check privileges → `whoami` (who am I?)  
- Clean workspace → `clear` (fresh start!)

## 💪 Next Level

You've just had your first real conversation with Linux! These might seem simple, but they're the foundation of everything you'll do.

**Pro Tip:** Try combining commands with `&&`:
```bash
pwd && whoami && clear
```{{exec}}

This runs all three commands in sequence!

**🎉 Congratulations!** You're no longer afraid of the terminal - it's becoming your friend!
