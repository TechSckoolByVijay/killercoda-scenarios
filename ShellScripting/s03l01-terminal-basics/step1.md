# Step 1 â€” Where Am I? (pwd)

Welcome to your first Linux command! ðŸŽ¯

Imagine you've just opened the terminal and you're wondering: **"Where am I right now?"** Not existentially - literally, in the file system!

## The Command: pwd

```bash
pwd && echo "pwd-executed" > /tmp/step1_completed
```{{exec}}

**pwd** stands for **Print Working Directory** - it simply tells you your current location in Linux.

### ðŸ§­ What You'll See

When you run `pwd`, you might see something like:
```
/root
```

This means you're inside the `/root` directory - think of it as your current address in the Linux city.

### ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Analogy

Think of Linux like a huge city, and `pwd` is your **Google Maps "You Are Here" marker**. Before moving anywhere, it's good to know where you currently stand.

### ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

- **Debugging**: Know exactly where your scripts are running
- **File Operations**: Understand relative vs absolute paths
- **Navigation**: Never get lost in the directory maze

**Your Task:** Run the `pwd` command above and see your current location!
