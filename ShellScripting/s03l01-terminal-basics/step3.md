# Step 3 — Clean Slate (clear)

Time to tidy up! 🧹

As you type more commands, your terminal starts looking messy - like your desk on a Monday morning. Let's fix that!

## The Command: clear

```bash
clear
```{{exec}}

---

### ✨ What Happens

**Boom!** Clean slate. Your terminal screen becomes fresh and ready for the next set of commands.

### 🗂️ Important Note

Your previous commands are still there (you can scroll up to see them), but the screen **feels** clean and organized.

### 🎯 Real-World Analogy

Think of `clear` like **cleaning your whiteboard** before starting a new lesson. The old notes aren't erased from memory, but you have a fresh space to work with.

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Use `clear` when your screen gets cluttered
- Great for taking screenshots of clean terminal sessions
- Helps you focus on current tasks without visual noise
- Essential for presentation or demo purposes

### 🚀 Keyboard Shortcut

Want to be faster? Use `Ctrl + L` instead of typing `clear` - same result!

**Your Task:** Run the `clear` command and watch your terminal become spotless!

Click **Check** when you've cleared your screen.
