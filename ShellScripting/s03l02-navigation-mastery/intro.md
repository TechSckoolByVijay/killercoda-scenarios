# Welcome to Navigation Mastery! 🧭

Ready to explore the Linux world like a digital traveler? 🗺️

You've learned where you are (`pwd`) and who you are (`whoami`). Now it's time to **move around the Linux city** and see what's inside different neighborhoods!

## What You'll Master:
- **ls** - Your eyes in the Linux world (see what's around you)
- **cd** - Your teleportation device (move anywhere instantly)  
- **Paths** - Absolute vs Relative addressing (like GPS coordinates)

## The Navigation Triangle:
1. **pwd** - Where am I?
2. **ls** - What can I see here?  
3. **cd** - Let me go there!

## Real-World Impact:
Master these and you'll navigate through Linux systems faster than clicking through any file explorer. DevOps engineers use these commands hundreds of times daily!

## Path Philosophy:
Think of Linux like a huge building:
- **Absolute path**: From main gate (/) to your exact room
- **Relative path**: From where you stand to nearby rooms
