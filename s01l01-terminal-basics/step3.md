# Step 3 — Clean Screen (clear) 🧹

Excellent! You've mastered `pwd` and `whoami`. Now let's learn about keeping your workspace organized.

## The clear Command

As you type more commands, your terminal starts to look messy — like your desk on a Monday morning! 😄

The `clear` command gives you a **fresh, clean screen** to work with.

## 1. Let's Create Some Clutter First

Let's run a few commands to make our screen busy:

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

```bash
whoami
```{{exec}}

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

```bash
whoami
```{{exec}}

See how the screen is getting crowded? Let's fix that!

## 2. Clean Your Screen

Now for the magic command that cleans everything up:

```bash
clear
```{{exec}}

🎯 **What happened?** Your screen is now clean and fresh!

## 3. Your Commands Are Still There

Don't worry! `clear` doesn't delete your command history. Try scrolling up with your mouse or arrow keys — you'll see all your previous commands are still there.

Let's verify with a quick command:

```bash
whoami
```{{exec}}

See? Everything still works perfectly!

## 4. Practice the Complete Workflow

Let's practice the typical workflow:

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

```bash
whoami
```{{exec}}

```bash
clear
```{{exec}}

Perfect! Now you have a clean workspace to continue your Linux journey.
