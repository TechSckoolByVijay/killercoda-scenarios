# Step 1 — Where Am I? (pwd) 🧭

Welcome to your first Linux command! Let's start with the most fundamental question: **Where am I?**

## The pwd Command

When you open a terminal, you might wonder: "Where am I in this computer?" 

That's exactly what `pwd` answers. It stands for **Print Working Directory**.

## 1. Find Your Current Location

Let's discover where you are right now:

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

🎯 **What happened?** Linux just told you your exact location in the file system!

---

## 2. Understanding the Output

You probably saw something like `/root` or `/home/username`. This is your **current directory path**.

Think of it like this:
- Linux is a huge city 🏙️
- `pwd` is your **"You Are Here"** marker on Google Maps
- The path shows your exact address in the Linux city

---

## 3. Try It Again!

Let's practice this essential command one more time:

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

Notice how it gives you the **same answer**? That's because you haven't moved yet!

---

## 🎯 Real-World Analogy

Think of `pwd` like asking **"What street am I on?"** 
- Before moving anywhere, it's good to know where you currently are
- This becomes super important when you start navigating folders
- Every Linux professional uses this command daily!

## 💡 Key Takeaway

`pwd` = **Print Working Directory** = **"Where am I right now?"**

This is your GPS coordinate in the Linux world. Before we learn to move around, we need to know where we're starting from!
