# Step 1 — Find Your Location & Identity 🗺️

Welcome to your Linux adventure! Let's start by getting oriented - just like when you arrive in a new city, you need to know where you are and who you are! 🧭

## 📝 Practice Exercise 1: Where Am I Right Now?

First, let's discover your current location in the file system. Think of this like checking your GPS coordinates:

```bash
pwd
```{{exec}}

**What we're doing:** Using `pwd` (Print Working Directory) to show your exact location  
**What you'll see:** A path like `/root` or `/home/ubuntu` - this is your current "address" in the Linux file system! 📍

## 📝 Practice Exercise 2: Who Am I in This System?

Now let's find out your identity in this Linux system. Every user has a unique name:

```bash
whoami
```{{exec}}

**What we're doing:** Using `whoami` to discover your username in this system  
**What you'll see:** Your username displayed - this tells you which user account you're logged in as! 👤

## 📝 Practice Exercise 3: Clear the Clutter for a Fresh Start

Let's clean up your terminal screen to have a nice, clear workspace for the next commands:

```bash
clear
```{{exec}}

**What we're doing:** Using `clear` to wipe the terminal screen clean  
**What you'll see:** A fresh, empty terminal screen - perfect for starting your next task with a clean slate! ✨

Great job! You've mastered the essential orientation commands. You now know where you are, who you are, and how to keep your workspace tidy! Ready to explore your environment? →
